# Weather App

The purpose of this project was to learn about APIs, basic JSON and promises and practice using fetch() and Date() object in Javascript by building a weather app.

## The problem

I followed the different steps described in the brief. It was well explained and quite straight forward, except when it came to format the date. It took me an hour to realize that the time in the API was not in milliseconds :-) The styling was a bit hard because I needed to adjust it in different ways every time I worked on a stretched goal. I used the "mobile first" approach, with different media queries and content for tablet and desktop.

In addition to the minimum requirements (fetching data from 2 APIs, displaying weather info, sunrise, sunset and 5 days forecast and styling), I worked on the following stretched goals:
- display background gradient based on temperature (and even background images based on weather and time on tablet and desktop)
- add a city selector (and even a city search on tablet and desktop)
- display visual indicators based on weather
- use geolocation at page loading

If I had more time, I would have improved the "12.00 method" in the forecast, added CSS animations and fetched data from other APIs.
